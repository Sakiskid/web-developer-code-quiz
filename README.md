# Web Developer Coding Quiz

### [Click Here To Play](link)

#### **8/13/2020** 


## Features
- Multiple categories of questions (choose all of them to score even more points!)
- Locally stored leaderboard
- Randomized answer positions (no cheating by memorizing positions)
- Modular questions and leaderboard so they can be easily modified

##### Noteworthy:


## Execution:
1. Created HTML / CSS Layout
2. Added script solely to hold the questions in an object array
3. Made questions appear randomly with answers in random positions
4. Added Game Over Screen
- When the answer buttons are created, an onclick attribute with either the respective "correctAnswer" or "wrongAnswer" function attached to them
- The Questions are drawn from a questions.js file where they are stored in an object array
- The Leaderboard is also an object array, and I remade it to be modular so that it can hold any number of entries and iterate through them (for example, it would be easier to create a multiple page leaderboard with this)

### Things I learned
- How to use Psuedoelements! They are awesome!!! I used them to create the main #quiz-area
